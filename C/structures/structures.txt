structure is a user defined data type consists of group of variables of different data types under single name.


syntax : 
	struct struct_name
	{
		datatype member1;
		datatype member2;
	};
	
	
	
	we cannot initialize the members while declaring them inside a structure.
	
	
	We can initialize structure members in 3 ways 
		Using Assignment Operator.
		Using Initializer List.
		Using Designated Initializer List.
		
		
		1)struct structure_name str;
		  str.member1 = value1;
		  str.member2 = value2;
		  
		2)struct structure_name str = { value1, value2, value3 };
		
		3)struct structure_name str = { .member1 = value1, .member2 = value2, .member3 = value3 };
		
		
self referntial structure: if a structure contains a  pointer pointing to the same structure type as a member then it is called as self referntial structure.



Structure padding is the concept of adding multiple empty bytes in the structure to naturally align the data members in the memory.

There are some situations where we need to pack the structure tightly by removing the empty bytes. In such cases, we use Structure Packing. 


Bit Fields are used to specify the length of the structure members in bits.
